Last updated: 1.11.2023

## Introduction

Welcome to the privacy policy for SiiliCam Free and SiiliCam Pro (hereafter referred to as "SiiliCam"). This document describes how SiiliCam collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our applications.

SiiliCam is designed to use your device's camera data and send it over Wi-Fi to connected devices within a private network. The app broadcasts its name via mDNS, meaning only devices within the same private network can connect. The app also identifies your phone by its name, for example, G970F1 for a Samsung device.

By using SiiliCam, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information We Collect

### Camera Data

We collect data from your device's camera to enable video streaming over Wi-Fi. This involves the following permissions:

- `android.permission.CAMERA`
- `android.hardware.camera`
- `android.hardware.camera.autofocus`

### Network Information

We collect network-related information to enable the broadcasting and connection over Wi-Fi through mDNS. The following permissions are used for this purpose:

- `android.permission.INTERNET`
- `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`
- `android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE`

### Wake Lock & Foreground Service

We use the following permissions to keep the app running efficiently:

## How We Use The Information

The collected data is used solely for enabling SiiliCam's video streaming features and network connectivity. We do not use this data for advertising, nor do we sell or share this data with third parties.

## Security

We are committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access, we use modern cryptographic techniques for transmitting your data over Wi-Fi.

## Runtime Permissions

SiiliCam requests runtime permissions for each specific feature that requires access to sensitive data. Consent for these permissions is requested within the app and is mandatory for the functioning of the app.

## Consent

Upon first launch of SiiliCam, you will be presented with a consent dialog that outlines the data we collect and how it is used. Using the app implies that you consent to this data collection and usage.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update our Privacy Policy at any time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "last updated" date at the top of this document.
